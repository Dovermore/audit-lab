Routines to compute Bayes risk for a contest, or for a set of contests.

Called by audit.py

This is designed to be compatible only with sampling by pbcid;
more elaborate sampling regimes, such as sampling by card number
(for multicard ballots) or by reported vote, are yet to be

# Multinomial distribution

def multinomial(n, ps):
    """
    Given nonnegative value n (typically an int) and a dict ps of probabilities, 
    return sample of size n drawn according to multinomial distribution defined with the 
    given probabilities.

    This is similar to numpy.random.multinomial (which it uses), but
        -- its input (ps) is a dict rather than an array
           the input domain is a set of votes (tuples of selids) and
           the output range are probabilities.
        -- the output (freq) is a dict rather than an array, mapping
           votes (tuples of selids) to frequencies.  The domain of freq
           is equal to the domain of ps.  The values in freq are nonnegative
           and sum to n.
        -- The standard definition of a multinomial distribution only allows for
           sample sizes n that are integers, and only gives frequencies that
           are integers.  The current routine encompasses this as a special case:
           when n is an integer the frequencies are integers distributed according
           to the standard multinomial definition.

           But when n is not an integer, this routine still returns a 
           meaningful result (although there is no definition I could find in the
           literature for a multinomial distribution with non-integral values of n).
           This result is accomplished by adding, to each vote, the
           fractional part of n multiplied by the given probability for that vote.
           This extension ensures that risk_bayes will give reasonable results 
           even in situations (like, perhaps weighted STV voting) where votes are
           present with non-integral frequencies.  (This feature is not yet used.)

    Remark: This approach of having prior defined by exactly two
            pseudocounts is intended to allow prior to reflect 
            belief that scanners are largely accurate, by having
            pseudocount_match be large, while preserving symmetry 
            among kinds of errors, by having all other entries only
            equal to pseudocount_base.

            Note that vote rv does not need to be in vs, in which 
            case all entries are equal to pseudocount_base.

    Remark: The vote ("-noCVR",) is treated specially, in that a 
            reported vote of ("-noCVR",) is NOT expected to yield
            an actual vote of the same value; all other reported votes
            are expected to yield an actual vote of the same value
            as the reported vote.  This is reflected by having a

    Compute (estimate) Bayesian risk (chance that reported

    We take sn_tcpra here as argument rather than just use e.sn_tcpra so
    we can call compute_contest_risk with modified sample counts.
    (This option not yet used, but might be later, when optimizing
    workload.)
    Here sn_tcpra is identical in structure to (and may in fact be
    identical to) e.sn_tcpra.

    least for those outcome rules and mixes of collection types for
    which a frequentist method is known.

    The comparison and ballot-polling audits are blended here; the
    reported election data just records a ("-noCVR",) vote for the 
    reported vote in a noCVR paper ballot collection.

    This means that ballot-polling audits have a prior of pseudocount_base,
    while comparison audits have a prior of pseudocount_base for off-diagonal
    (non-equal reported and actual) vote pairs, but a prior of pseudocount_match
    for equal reported-vote and actual-vote pairs.

    Note also that for ballot-polling audits, the vote of ("-noCVR",) is part
    of e.votes_c[cid], so that the test tallies include an estimated tally for
    this vote.  This should be conservative, but might be something to be
